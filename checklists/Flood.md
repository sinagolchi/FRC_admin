## Flood and Damage analysis
This section generates a flood event and assists with calculation of flood damage

Check list: 

1. Set a timer in Miro for 5 minutes
2. A flood would have been generated by the game admin, if not there will be two options to generate a flood: 
    1. Random: randomly generates a flood
    2. Manual: manually selecting a flood event
3. The flood event in effect in that round will show up ina blue information box, and the damage analysis table will show up. The tables lists the roles affected by the flood, the severity, status of insurance, eligibility for DRP, and finally if the role was affected by the flood or not.
    1. Make sure to apply the proper flood overlay onto the game board (it should be a snug fit, do not try to readjust the size of the overlay)
4. It is up to the facilitator to decide which roles are protected by the FRM measures in place:
    1. Look up the roles in the Miro board to determine if they are protected by FRM measures in place
    2. Using the multi-select option select all roles that are protected by FRM measures.
5. Once you are sure about the status of roles, click on "Submit flood details", this will update the database and ensures that the damage amounts are taken away from budgets of affected roles.
6. Process the insurance claims of the insured roles by clicking on "Submit insurance claims"
7. If there are roles that **were not insured** and **not protected** but are eligible for DRP payment, advise them to ask the provincial politician to transfer their DRP payments
    * This should happen during the transaction phase of next round
