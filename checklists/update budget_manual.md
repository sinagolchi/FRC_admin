## Phase 3: Update Budget phase
The students in this section will pay their taxes and mandatory payments which will make up the income of other users. It is the facilitator responsibility to ensure students are paying their taxes. The payments are automatic, students have one button for paying taxes and another for mandatory payments.
But it is up to you to check if they have done so before the phase ends.
Follow the checklist below for a successful budget updating phase:

### Checklist:

1. Remind students to refresh data to see the phase settings
1. Set a timer for 5 minutes in Miro
2. Set the phase selector to Phase 3 to see the databases for tax and mandatory payments
3. Make sure that you are looking at the right game round in the tables, this is set automatically by the game admin, notify the game admin if it is not right.
4. Monitor the payment status for both taxes and Mandatory payments:
    1. None (in gray text) means the role is not required to make a payment
    2. false (in red text) means the role is required to make a payment but still have not submitted the payment
    3. true (in green text) means the role have made the payment
5. Make sure to refresh data often to see the latest update of the payments
6. Notify students/roles that have not made the payment (flagged with false) before the time runs out
